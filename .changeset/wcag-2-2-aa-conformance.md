WCAG 2.2 AA conformance across the system, and the tests that keep it.

`<a class="ds-button ds-button--accent">` rendered amber-on-amber on hover — 2.31:1 in light, 1.00:1 in dark, failing SC 1.4.3. The cause was specificity, not a bad colour: the global `a:hover` is (0,1,1) and beats a (0,1,0) variant class, and the variant's `:hover` only moved `background-color`. Auditing for the same shape turned up 14 more failures, most of them dark-mode only.

**New tokens.** `--border-control` (3.64:1 / 3.95:1) for control edges, separating them from the now explicitly decorative `--border` and `--border-strong`. `--fg-disabled` (4.85:1 / 7.87:1) for disabled control text, separating it from the decorative `--fg-4`. `--accent-ink` (9.69:1 / 10.17:1) for brand amber a user reads, separating it from the 2.53:1 `--accent` fill. `--status-*-fg` and `--status-*-tint` complete each status set, so a tinted panel's fill and its text always theme together. `--link-on-fill` keeps a link on a filled surface from being repainted by the global `a:hover`.

**Changed values.** `--link-hover` moves from `--signal-700` to `--signal-800` (5.86:1 to 9.69:1). `--status-success` gains a dark override — forest green was 2.58:1 on a black page.

**Breaking-ish, in the visual sense.** Component colours change. A filled variant now restates `color` in every state; control edges, disabled text and status text point at the new tokens; and components no longer paint fixed base-scale values (`--ink-*`, `--signal-*`, `--anchor-*`), which is what made a tab underline, a switch track and a tooltip invisible in dark mode. `Rating` draws `★` and `☆` rather than one glyph in two colours — the value was carried by colour alone, which is SC 1.4.1.

Tailwind consumers get the split through the bridge: `border-control`, `text-foreground-disabled`, `text-accent-ink`, and `bg-*-tint` / `text-*-ink` per status. `border-input` now resolves to `--border-control`.

**Enforcement.** Three new test layers fail the build rather than documenting the rule: `contrast.mjs`/`contrast.test.mjs` measure every meaningful token against `--bg` in both themes plus the fill/text pairs; `component-css.test.mjs` checks control edges, the restated `color`, and the base-scale ban; `button-contrast.test.mjs` resolves the real cascade over the shipped stylesheets and measures what the label actually renders as. The colour math moved to `@elirobinson/tokens/color` so the gate and the docs cannot disagree.

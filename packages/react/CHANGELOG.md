# @elirobinson/react

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 1f88949: `NavigationMenu`: make `href` optional on `NavigationMenuItem`. An item without one renders
  as an inert `<span>` group label instead of an `<a>` — not focusable, not a navigation
  target, and never marked as the current page — and names its nested list via
  `aria-labelledby`.

  Previously a section header had to borrow its first child's href to satisfy the required
  `href`, which made the header render as active whenever that child was open and emitted a
  second `aria-current="page"` alongside the real one.

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 0dbb837: Fix `defaultOpen` being silently ignored on all four overlay components.

  `Dialog`, `Sheet`, `Popover`, and `DropdownMenu` each declared
  `defaultOpen?: boolean` in their props type, but none of them destructured it —
  every one hardcoded `useState(false)`. The prop typechecked, so consumers had
  no signal it did nothing; `<Dialog defaultOpen>` simply rendered closed.

  All four now seed their uncontrolled state from `defaultOpen`. A controlled
  `open` prop still wins, so `defaultOpen` only applies when `open` is omitted.

  Note for `Popover` and `DropdownMenu`: now that `defaultOpen` works, it reaches
  the same portal that `open` does, so a server-rendered `defaultOpen` overlay
  relies on the mount gate added alongside it — its content appears one commit
  after hydration rather than in the server markup.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 4b507a2: Fix portal components crashing during server rendering.

  `Toaster`, `PopoverContent`, and `DropdownMenuContent` called
  `createPortal(…, document.body)` during render, so a Next.js or Remix consumer
  hit `ReferenceError: document is not defined` at SSR/build time.

  `Toaster` was broken outright — it portals on every render, so merely wrapping
  an app in it took the build down, and because `useToast` throws outside the
  provider there was no client-only workaround. `Popover` and `DropdownMenu` were
  conditional: both return early while closed, so they only crashed when
  server-rendered already open via the `open` prop.

  All three now gate the portal on a new shared `useHasMounted` hook. The server
  pass and the first client render agree (no portal), so hydration stays clean,
  and the content attaches on the commit that follows. `Tooltip` already guarded
  on its trigger ref and was never affected; it gains regression coverage.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- af5497d: Move every published component under an atomic-tier subpath (`atoms/`, `molecules/`, `organisms/`) and add 19 new components.

  **Breaking: import paths now include the atomic tier.**

  ```diff
  - import { Button } from '@elirobinson/react/components/Button';
  + import { Button } from '@elirobinson/react/components/atoms/Button';
  ```

  Every existing component moved to its tier — e.g. `Card`/`Alert` → `components/molecules/`, `Badge`/`Button`/`Input`/`Avatar` → `components/atoms/`, `Dialog`/`Select`/`Tabs` → `components/organisms/`. See `docs/agents/components.md` for the full tier boundary rule and the shadcn mapping table.

  New components, by tier:
  - **atoms**: `RadioGroup`/`RadioGroupItem`, `Spinner`, `Slider`, `Kbd`
  - **molecules**: `Chip`, `FormField`, `SearchField`, `Pagination`, `Stepper`, `SegmentedControl`, `EmptyState`, `Rating`
  - **organisms**: `VirtualList`, `Accordion`, `DatePicker`, `Combobox`, `Table`, `VirtualTable`, `NavigationMenu`, `CommandPalette`
  - **hooks**: `useActiveDescendant`, `useRovingFocus`

  New dependencies: `@tanstack/react-table`, `@tanstack/react-virtual`.

  **Per-component stylesheets.** `@elirobinson/react/styles.css` is unchanged as the
  single entry point and still carries every component. Individual stylesheets are
  now also importable for consumers who want to pull in only what they use:

  ```ts
  import '@elirobinson/react/styles/atoms/Button.css';
  ```

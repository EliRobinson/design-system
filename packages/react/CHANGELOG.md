## 2.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 8cc5a0b: Give the brand tints dark values, and add `--anchor-ink`. Closes #60.

  `--accent-tint` and `--anchor-tint` were the last colours in the system with no
  dark override: `--signal-50` and `--anchor-50` stayed 96–97% light on a black
  page. That reached consumers directly — both are aliased in the Tailwind bridge,
  and `tailwind.css` recommends `bg-accent-tint` as the substitute for shadcn's
  "accent as hover tint", so taking that advice produced a near-white block in
  dark mode. They now mirror the way `--status-*-tint` already worked, a wash at
  the same hue: `oklch(22% 0.05 70)` amber, `oklch(20% 0.04 160)` forest.

  **New token: `--anchor-ink`** (`--anchor-600`, 11.41:1 light; `oklch(78% 0.13 160)`,
  11.07:1 dark) — the forest counterpart to `--accent-ink`. `--anchor` itself is
  8.13:1 on white but 2.58:1 on black, so forest text needed a token that inverts.
  It is aliased as `text-anchor-ink`, and is measured against `--bg` in both
  themes by the same rule that covers `--accent-ink`.

  **`Badge`'s `signal` and `anchor` variants** painted the ramp directly
  (`--signal-100`/`--signal-800`, `--anchor-100`/`--anchor-700`). Those were
  self-consistent fixed pairs at 8.05:1 and 11.84:1 — and still a 94%-light chip
  sitting beside a `default` badge that had inverted properly. They now paint
  `--accent-tint`/`--accent-ink` and `--anchor-tint`/`--anchor-ink`: measured in
  the browser at 8.96:1 light / 8.43:1 dark and 10.23:1 / 9.45:1, with the chip
  now within 1.21:1 of the page in either theme instead of glaring against it.

  Both variants are one ramp step lighter in light mode than before (the 50 step
  rather than 100), which is what makes them share one tint token with every other
  tinted brand surface. Text contrast goes up, not down.

  With that, the exemption list in `component-css.test.mjs` is down to a single
  geometry-only selector: the two badges were the reason it existed, and an
  exemption that outlives its reason is how a sweep goes quiet. `contrast.test.mjs`
  now asserts both tint pairs per theme.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 84aef19: WCAG 2.2 AA conformance across the system, and the tests that keep it.

  `<a class="ds-button ds-button--accent">` rendered amber-on-amber on hover — 2.31:1 in light, 1.00:1 in dark, failing SC 1.4.3. The cause was specificity, not a bad colour: the global `a:hover` is (0,1,1) and beats a (0,1,0) variant class, and the variant's `:hover` only moved `background-color`. Auditing for the same shape turned up 14 more failures, most of them dark-mode only.

  **New tokens.** `--border-control` (3.64:1 / 3.95:1) for control edges, separating them from the now explicitly decorative `--border` and `--border-strong`. `--fg-disabled` (4.85:1 / 7.87:1) for disabled control text, separating it from the decorative `--fg-4`. `--accent-ink` (9.69:1 / 10.17:1) for brand amber a user reads, separating it from the 2.53:1 `--accent` fill. `--status-*-fg` and `--status-*-tint` complete each status set, so a tinted panel's fill and its text always theme together. `--link-on-fill` keeps a link on a filled surface from being repainted by the global `a:hover`.

  **Changed values.** `--link-hover` moves from `--signal-700` to `--signal-800` (5.86:1 to 9.69:1). `--status-success` gains a dark override — forest green was 2.58:1 on a black page.

  **Breaking-ish, in the visual sense.** Component colours change. A filled variant now restates `color` in every state; control edges, disabled text and status text point at the new tokens; and components no longer paint fixed base-scale values (`--ink-*`, `--signal-*`, `--anchor-*`), which is what made a tab underline, a switch track and a tooltip invisible in dark mode. `Rating` draws `★` and `☆` rather than one glyph in two colours — the value was carried by colour alone, which is SC 1.4.1.

  Tailwind consumers get the split through the bridge: `border-control`, `text-foreground-disabled`, `text-accent-ink`, and `bg-*-tint` / `text-*-ink` per status. `border-input` now resolves to `--border-control`.

  **Enforcement.** Three new test layers fail the build rather than documenting the rule: `contrast.mjs`/`contrast.test.mjs` measure every meaningful token against `--bg` in both themes plus the fill/text pairs; `component-css.test.mjs` checks control edges, the restated `color`, and the base-scale ban; `button-contrast.test.mjs` resolves the real cascade over the shipped stylesheets and measures what the label actually renders as. The colour math moved to `@elirobinson/tokens/color` so the gate and the docs cannot disagree.

### Patch Changes

- b963fc1: Fix a checked `Checkbox` disappearing on a dark page, and widen the sweep that should have caught it.

  `.ds-checkbox__input` painted `accent-color: var(--ink-1000)`. `accent-color`
  is what fills the box when a native checkbox is checked, so the checked state
  was pure black in both themes — 1.00:1 against a dark page, the same defect as
  the tab underline and the switch track that the WCAG 2.2 AA pass fixed. It is
  `var(--fg)` now: 21:1 in both themes.

  It survived that pass because `scripts/component-css.test.mjs` matched painted
  properties with a pattern that read the `-color` in `accent-color` as the tail
  of a border property, so the declaration matched nothing and the sweep reported
  the file clean. The property list is now explicit and also covers
  `caret-color`, `outline-color`, `text-decoration-color`, `fill` and `stroke`.
  No other component was painting a base-scale value through one of them.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- cc6dd9d: Narrow the `./styles/*` export to `./styles/*.css`.

  The subpath was mapped straight onto the components directory:

  ```json
  "./styles/*": "./src/components/*"
  ```

  Anything under `src/components` resolved through it, so
  `@elirobinson/react/styles/atoms/Button.tsx` was a valid import — raw,
  untranspiled component source reachable through a path named "styles". The map
  is now `"./styles/*.css": "./src/components/*.css"`, which serves stylesheets
  and nothing else.

  **Migration:** every documented and generated specifier already ends in `.css`
  (`@elirobinson/react/styles/atoms/Button.css`, and nested sheets like
  `@elirobinson/react/styles/organisms/table/core.css`) and is unaffected —
  verified by resolving all 41 unique `stylesheetPaths` in the component manifest
  (49 occurrences) under both the CJS and ESM resolvers. If you were importing
  anything else through `styles/*`, import the component from
  `@elirobinson/react/components/<tier>/<Name>` instead.

  **Why `major` and not `minor`.** Serving TSX from `styles/*` was plainly
  unintended, and the argument for a smaller bump is real: no consumer can
  sensibly have depended on it, and 2.0.0 makes a version wall out of closing a
  hole nobody was meant to walk through. It is still a major. A subpath that
  resolved yesterday and throws `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED` today is a
  breaking change to the package's public surface whatever we meant the surface to
  be — the exports map _is_ the contract, and intent is not something a consumer's
  build can read. The upgrade costs nothing for correct usage, so the honest
  version number is cheap here; picking `minor` would buy a tidier changelog with
  someone else's broken build.

- 2c3c5e7: One llms corpus generator, owned by `@elirobinson/ai-patterns`.

  The generator that renders `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` existed twice, written
  independently and producing the same format: once in `apps/docs` for the live
  `/llms.txt` routes, once in this package for the snapshot that ships in the
  tarball. `INTRO` and the import rules were duplicated character for character;
  the prop tables, component sections, and index were reimplemented. Both files
  opened with a comment asserting the other was its twin, which is not a mechanism
  — they had already drifted.

  There is now one implementation, published as `@elirobinson/ai-patterns/corpus`
  (`llmsIndex`, `llmsFull`, `versionStamp`, `RESYNC_COMMAND`), with a hand-written
  `llms.d.ts` and a drift test against it, matching how `./testing/playwright` is
  published. It is parameterized by the four things that genuinely differ between
  the two callers, each optional and absent by default:
  - `versions` — stamps the output as a snapshot. The docs site passes none.
  - `prose` — the Foundations and Patterns pages, as plain markdown.
  - `componentAppendix` — extra blocks per component section; the docs site
    appends the page prose and a `/r/<slug>.json` link.
  - `alsoAvailable` — the "what else is here" bullets, which are URLs on a website
    and filenames plus a CLI in a tarball.

  The packed snapshot is byte-identical to what it produced before, and so is the
  docs `/llms.txt`. Two docs outputs change, both deliberately:
  - `/llms-full.txt` gains exactly one trailing newline, so neither a file nor a
    `text/plain` body ends mid-line. Nothing else in it moves.
  - `/r/<slug>.json` spreads the manifest record, so its `importPath` key is now
    `importSpecifier` — the same rename described below, surfacing on the one
    machine-readable route that isn't a corpus.

  Two fixes that only became possible once there was one reader:
  - Component order is driven off `manifest.tiers` rather than a hardcoded
    `['atoms', 'molecules', 'organisms']` in each copy. A tier added to
    `@elirobinson/react` used to drop every component in it out of the corpus
    silently; it now appears, and a component the manifest gives no tier is
    emitted after the tiers rather than discarded.
  - `@elirobinson/react`'s manifest drops `importPath`, which was a byte-identical
    alias of `importSpecifier` published only so the docs site and the `ds` CLI
    could each keep their own name for it. `importSpecifier` is the one name.

  Removing a published manifest field is breaking, so `@elirobinson/react` is
  marked `major`. It is already taking a `major` in this batch, and the field
  being removed was introduced in this same unreleased batch, so no released
  reader ever saw it — but the manifest is a published contract and the bump
  should say what happened to it rather than what it cost.

### Minor Changes

- 363f9da: Forward refs through `DialogTrigger`, `DialogClose`, `SheetTrigger` and
  `SheetClose`, and widen their props to `ButtonHTMLAttributes`.

  All four render a `<button>` but were plain function components, which the
  `forward-ref` contract has always disallowed:

  > Every component that renders a focusable or interactive native element uses
  > `forwardRef`, forwarding to the outermost interactive element the component
  > owns.

  They all delegate to the shared `ModalTrigger` / `ModalClose` parts, so the fix
  is one `forwardRef` in the shared parts plus forwarding through the four public
  wrappers. The refs resolve to the `<button>` node itself. These parts own their
  button outright and hold no second reference to it, so they forward the ref
  directly rather than merging it the way `ModalSurface` has to.

  **On React 19 the runtime half of this already worked by accident.** `ref` is an
  ordinary prop for function components there, so it rode the `{...props}` spread
  down to the `<button>`. The defect that bit consumers was at the type level: the
  props were `HTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>`, which carries no `ref` and no
  button attributes, so `<DialogTrigger ref={...}>` and `<DialogClose disabled>`
  were both type errors on components that would have honoured them at runtime.

  **Props widening.** The four props types are now
  `ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>`, matching `DropdownMenuTriggerProps`
  and `DropdownMenuItemProps`. This adds `disabled`, `type`, `form`, `name` and
  `value`, and is additive — every currently valid usage still compiles.

  `type="button"` stays a default rather than a pin: it precedes the prop spread,
  so a consumer-supplied `type` wins. That matches `DropdownMenuItem`,
  `ToastAction` and `AnchoredOverlayTrigger`, and it keeps a close button that
  also submits an enclosing form expressible. Accepting `type` in the props type
  and then silently discarding it would be the worse option — a prop the types
  advertise and the component ignores.

- b393053: One component manifest, owned by `@elirobinson/react`.

  `./manifest` now carries everything the two extractors used to produce
  separately. Alongside the existing `name` / `tier` / `subpath` /
  `importSpecifier` / `exports` / `types` / `propsType` / `variants`, every
  component record gains `slug`, `description`, `props` (full prop tables with
  types, defaults, required flags, and per-prop JSDoc), `subComponents`, `hooks`,
  `inherits`, `stylesheetPaths`, `constraints`, and `extractionGaps`; hook records
  gain `description`. `manifestVersion` is `2`. `./manifest` also gains a `types`
  condition, so it is a typed import rather than an `any`.

  `minor` rather than `major`: every v1 field keeps its name and its meaning, so a
  v1 reader keeps working. Three things do change, none of them a v1 field:
  - `inherits` now names bases the previous regex-based extractor gave up on
    (`Table`, `VirtualList`, `VirtualTable`, `Accordion` said `null` and now name
    the type they extend).
  - `organisms/table/core`, which exports helpers `Table` and `VirtualTable`
    share rather than a component of its own name, is no longer listed as a
    component. It was never importable as one, and the types it exports
    (`ColumnDef` and friends) are re-exported from `Table`.
  - The docs-side record's `exportedTypes` is not carried over under that name —
    `types`, which the manifest already published, is the same list derived from
    the AST rather than a regex, and a superset of it.

  Descriptions for components whose source carries no JSDoc still come from a
  curated fallback list, which moved with the extractor to
  `packages/react/scripts/component-descriptions.json`. It moved rather than being
  replaced because removing it means writing JSDoc on 44 components in
  `packages/react/src`, which this change deliberately does not touch; its header
  now says out loud that every entry in it is debt.

  `@elirobinson/ai-patterns` is a `patch`: its published output is unchanged, but
  `build-artifacts.mjs` now reads `@elirobinson/react/manifest` instead of a
  generated file inside `apps/docs`, so producing the tarball no longer depends on
  a documentation app.

### Patch Changes

- 073be2b: Extract the overlay primitives the organisms were duplicating, and fix a duplicate-id accessibility bug that fell out of the copy.
  - New `useDisclosure` hook (`@elirobinson/react/hooks/useDisclosure`) owns the controlled/uncontrolled open-state pattern that `Dialog`, `Sheet`, `Popover`, and `DropdownMenu` each carried their own copy of.
  - `Dialog` and `Sheet` now build on one shared modal surface, and `Popover` and `DropdownMenu` on one shared anchored overlay.
  - **Accessibility fix:** `Dialog` and `Sheet` minted their title and description ids from the constants `ds-dialog-title` / `ds-sheet-title`. Two dialogs on one page emitted duplicate DOM ids, and every `aria-labelledby` resolved to whichever rendered first, so the second dialog announced the first one's title. Both now use `useId()`.
  - `Tooltip` uses the shared `useAnchoredPosition` hook instead of measuring its trigger during render, so it repositions on scroll and resize. `useAnchoredPosition` gained optional `align` and `zIndex` options and now keeps every anchored panel in place through scroll and resize.
  - `useClickOutside` and `useEscapeKey` no longer re-attach their document listeners on every render.

  No public API changes: every exported name, prop, and CSS class name is unchanged.

  - @elirobinson/tokens@0.4.0

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 37334d4: Upgrade `@tanstack/react-table` from v8 to v9 (`^9.1.2`) and rewrite `Table` / `VirtualTable`
  against the real v9 API — `useTable` plus a `tableFeatures()` feature set and
  `create*RowModel()` factories, replacing v8's `useReactTable` and `get*RowModel()` options.

  **Runtime dependency major.** `@tanstack/react-table` is a regular dependency of this package,
  so bumping it upgrades transitively and needs no action from you — unless you import
  `@tanstack/react-table` yourself. If your own code does
  `import type { ColumnDef } from '@tanstack/react-table'` and passes those columns to our
  `Table`, that type no longer matches: v9's `ColumnDef` takes the table's feature set as its
  first generic. Import `ColumnDef` from `@elirobinson/react/components/organisms/Table`
  instead, which is unchanged and still single-generic (`ColumnDef<Row>`).

  No change to any component's props, DOM, or behaviour. `Table` and `VirtualTable` keep the same
  public API, including `data`, `columns`, `pageSize`, `emptyMessage`, `filterable`, and
  `filterPlaceholder`, and the exported `ColumnDef<T>` type keeps the shape it had under v8.

  This deliberately does **not** use `@tanstack/react-table/legacy`, the library's `@deprecated`
  v8 compatibility shim, so no deprecated import reaches consumers. Features are registered
  individually rather than via `stockFeatures`, keeping grouping, pinning, resizing, selection,
  faceting, and expanding out of your bundle.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 8c7d56b: Generate `manifest.json` at build time and export it as `@elirobinson/react/manifest`.

  Per component: name, tier, import subpath, the exact import specifier, exported value
  names, exported type names, props type name, and variant unions with their allowed values —
  whether the union is written inline (`size?: 'sm' | 'md'`) or behind an exported alias
  (`variant?: ButtonVariant`). Hooks get the same treatment.

  This is the name → subpath map the `no-barrel-imports` contract has always implied was
  knowable but never published, and it lets tooling stop regex-parsing `dist/**/*.d.ts`. The
  manifest is built from the TypeScript AST, so it is not sensitive to how declarations
  happen to be emitted. Discovery walks `src/components` rather than assuming a layout; a
  flat directory yields `tier: null` and still works.

  Additive: every existing export subpath is unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- a82dcc9: Add `ds-resync`, a command for bringing a consuming repo's `@elirobinson/*` packages up to
  date. A bare run reports current versus latest per package along with the changelog entries
  in between; `--write` rewrites the ranges and installs.

  `@elirobinson/react` and `@elirobinson/tokens` now ship `CHANGELOG.md` in their published
  tarballs, which is what makes the migration notes readable from a consuming repo.

- Updated dependencies [a82dcc9]
- Updated dependencies [8c7d56b]
  - @elirobinson/tokens@0.3.0

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 1f88949: `NavigationMenu`: make `href` optional on `NavigationMenuItem`. An item without one renders
  as an inert `<span>` group label instead of an `<a>` — not focusable, not a navigation
  target, and never marked as the current page — and names its nested list via
  `aria-labelledby`.

  Previously a section header had to borrow its first child's href to satisfy the required
  `href`, which made the header render as active whenever that child was open and emitted a
  second `aria-current="page"` alongside the real one.

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 0dbb837: Fix `defaultOpen` being silently ignored on all four overlay components.

  `Dialog`, `Sheet`, `Popover`, and `DropdownMenu` each declared
  `defaultOpen?: boolean` in their props type, but none of them destructured it —
  every one hardcoded `useState(false)`. The prop typechecked, so consumers had
  no signal it did nothing; `<Dialog defaultOpen>` simply rendered closed.

  All four now seed their uncontrolled state from `defaultOpen`. A controlled
  `open` prop still wins, so `defaultOpen` only applies when `open` is omitted.

  Note for `Popover` and `DropdownMenu`: now that `defaultOpen` works, it reaches
  the same portal that `open` does, so a server-rendered `defaultOpen` overlay
  relies on the mount gate added alongside it — its content appears one commit
  after hydration rather than in the server markup.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 4b507a2: Fix portal components crashing during server rendering.

  `Toaster`, `PopoverContent`, and `DropdownMenuContent` called
  `createPortal(…, document.body)` during render, so a Next.js or Remix consumer
  hit `ReferenceError: document is not defined` at SSR/build time.

  `Toaster` was broken outright — it portals on every render, so merely wrapping
  an app in it took the build down, and because `useToast` throws outside the
  provider there was no client-only workaround. `Popover` and `DropdownMenu` were
  conditional: both return early while closed, so they only crashed when
  server-rendered already open via the `open` prop.

  All three now gate the portal on a new shared `useHasMounted` hook. The server
  pass and the first client render agree (no portal), so hydration stays clean,
  and the content attaches on the commit that follows. `Tooltip` already guarded
  on its trigger ref and was never affected; it gains regression coverage.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- af5497d: Move every published component under an atomic-tier subpath (`atoms/`, `molecules/`, `organisms/`) and add 19 new components.

  **Breaking: import paths now include the atomic tier.**

  ```diff
  - import { Button } from '@elirobinson/react/components/Button';
  + import { Button } from '@elirobinson/react/components/atoms/Button';
  ```

  Every existing component moved to its tier — e.g. `Card`/`Alert` → `components/molecules/`, `Badge`/`Button`/`Input`/`Avatar` → `components/atoms/`, `Dialog`/`Select`/`Tabs` → `components/organisms/`. See `docs/agents/components.md` for the full tier boundary rule and the shadcn mapping table.

  New components, by tier:
  - **atoms**: `RadioGroup`/`RadioGroupItem`, `Spinner`, `Slider`, `Kbd`
  - **molecules**: `Chip`, `FormField`, `SearchField`, `Pagination`, `Stepper`, `SegmentedControl`, `EmptyState`, `Rating`
  - **organisms**: `VirtualList`, `Accordion`, `DatePicker`, `Combobox`, `Table`, `VirtualTable`, `NavigationMenu`, `CommandPalette`
  - **hooks**: `useActiveDescendant`, `useRovingFocus`

  New dependencies: `@tanstack/react-table`, `@tanstack/react-virtual`.

  **Per-component stylesheets.** `@elirobinson/react/styles.css` is unchanged as the
  single entry point and still carries every component. Individual stylesheets are
  now also importable for consumers who want to pull in only what they use:

  ```ts
  import '@elirobinson/react/styles/atoms/Button.css';
  ```

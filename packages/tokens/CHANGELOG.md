# @elirobinson/tokens

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- c6cfaa0: Make `tokens.css` the only place the token set is written down.

  **`@elirobinson/tokens`**
  - `tokens.json` is now generated from `tokens.css` at build time. The
    hand-maintained file had drifted to 95 leaf values against 151 `:root` custom
    properties — `--signal-200/300/400/600/800/900` and
    `--anchor-200/300/400/600/800/900` were missing entirely, with nothing marking
    the file as partial. All 151 are now present. The nested shape and every key
    that existed before are unchanged, so `@elirobinson/tokens/tokens-data` and
    `@elirobinson/tokens/tokens.json` keep working; 62 leaves were added.
    Values are now copied verbatim out of the stylesheet, so a few that the
    hand-written file had padded change spelling without changing meaning
    (`oklch(86.0% …)` → `oklch(86% …)`).
  - New export `@elirobinson/tokens/parse-tokens-css` — the one CSS token parser,
    previously duplicated in three places across the monorepo.
  - The package has tests for the first time, including one that fails if
    `tokens.json` stops covering every `:root` custom property.

  **`@elirobinson/ai-patterns`**
  - The `colors_and_type.css` shipped into `.claude/skills/miltinson-design/` is
    now the tokens package's own `tokens.css` rather than a hand-kept sibling of
    it. The two had diverged: the copy consumers received was missing the `.dark`
    compatibility selector and the dark-mode `--focus-ring` override, so every
    `outline: 2px solid var(--focus-ring)` was black-on-black in dark mode — a
    silent failure of the `focusVisibleRequired` contract.
  - `ds tokens` now reads only `:root` and, when a token is declared twice, prints
    the declaration CSS actually applies. `--status-success` and
    `--status-warning` are re-pointed at brand colors after the base scale
    declares them, so they previously printed the shadowed value.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 8c7d56b: Ship `@elirobinson/tokens/tailwind.css`, a Tailwind v4 bridge, and fix dark-mode focus and
  theming compatibility.
  - **`tailwind.css`** aliases Tailwind's theme namespaces onto the semantic tokens, so
    `bg-background`, `text-muted-foreground`, `border-border`, `ring-ring`, `rounded-md`,
    `shadow-md`, `font-sans` and `ease-out` resolve to design system values instead of
    Tailwind's defaults — or, as consumers hit in practice, to nothing at all. Covers
    background, foreground, card, popover, primary, secondary, muted, accent, destructive,
    success, warning, info, border, input, ring, surface and anchor, plus `--radius` for the
    shadcn/ui components that read it directly. Consumers write one `@import` instead of
    maintaining ~30 aliases, and the shadcn `--accent: var(--accent)` circularity trap is
    handled rather than left to be rediscovered. Everything is `@theme inline`, so utilities
    keep responding to `[data-theme="dark"]` at runtime.
  - **`.dark` compatibility selector** alongside `[data-theme="dark"]`. Class-strategy theme
    switchers — `next-themes` defaults to one — previously toggled a class the stylesheet
    never looked at, so dark mode silently did nothing. `[data-theme="dark"]` remains the
    documented convention.
  - **`--focus-ring` now inverts in dark mode.** It was ink-on-white in both themes, which
    made every `outline: 2px solid var(--focus-ring)` in the component library invisible
    against a black page — a silent failure of the `focusVisibleRequired` contract.

  Additive: `tokens.css`, `tokens.json` and `tokens-data` are unchanged apart from the two
  dark-mode fixes above.

### Patch Changes

- a82dcc9: Add `ds-resync`, a command for bringing a consuming repo's `@elirobinson/*` packages up to
  date. A bare run reports current versus latest per package along with the changelog entries
  in between; `--write` rewrites the ranges and installs.

  `@elirobinson/react` and `@elirobinson/tokens` now ship `CHANGELOG.md` in their published
  tarballs, which is what makes the migration notes readable from a consuming repo.

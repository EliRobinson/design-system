### Patch Changes

- 8938d09: Split the tokens into three composable dials, and take status and chart colours off the brand.

  `tokens.css` was one file that hardcoded one brand. It is now three layers
  selected by three independent attributes on the root element:

  | Dial     | Attribute                     | Owns                                                                                   |
  | -------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | Palette  | `data-palette="ember\|slate"` | neutral hue/chroma, `--signal-*`, `--anchor-*`, `--accent*`, `--link*`, `--focus-ring` |
  | Theme    | `data-theme="light\|dark"`    | surfaces, and the re-picked values of all of the above                                 |
  | Platform | `data-platform="mobile"`      | radii, type floors, `--gutter`, control min-height                                     |

  `ember` is the default and its ramps are unchanged, so a consumer that sets no
  attribute renders almost exactly what it rendered before. The exceptions are
  real and are the two sections marked BREAKING below: the status colours moved
  off the brand, and a warning fill now has to be edged.

  ## Migration

  ### 1. Nothing to do for the new files

  `tokens.css` now `@import`s two siblings, `palettes.css` and `mobile.css`.
  Both ship in the package and both are in the `exports` map. If you import the
  stylesheet the normal way there is nothing to change:

  ```css
  @import '@elirobinson/tokens/tokens.css';
  ```

  **But** if your build copies `tokens.css` to a static directory, inlines it, or
  serves it from somewhere the two siblings are not, the imports dangle and the
  page renders with no colour at all. Copy `palettes.css` and `mobile.css`
  alongside it, or flatten the imports. Anything that reads the stylesheet as
  _data_ (a token table, a docs page, a script) must now read both files:

  ```js
  import { parseTokensCss } from '@elirobinson/tokens/parse-tokens-css';
  import { readTokenStylesheets } from '@elirobinson/tokens/token-stylesheets';

  // before: parseTokensCss(readFileSync('…/tokens.css', 'utf8'))
  const tokens = parseTokensCss(readTokenStylesheets(srcDir));
  ```

  `parseTokensCss` accepts an array now. Reading `tokens.css` alone does not
  throw — it silently returns a roster with no brand in it.

  ### 2. `--status-success` and `--status-warning` changed colour — BREAKING

  Status used to be made of brand. `--status-success` was `--anchor-500`
  (forest) and `--status-warning` was `--signal-600` — _the same amber as the
  primary CTA_, so a caution badge sat next to an accent button in the identical
  colour. Both now own their own hue and neither moves with the palette.

  | Token              | Was                   | Is now                   | Measured on `--bg`             |
  | ------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
  | `--status-success` | `var(--anchor-500)`   | `oklch(51.9% 0.145 150)` | 5.17:1 light, 4.06:1 dark      |
  | `--status-warning` | `var(--signal-600)`   | `oklch(80.25% 0.16 85)`  | **1.87:1** light, 11.22:1 dark |
  | `--status-danger`  | `oklch(58% 0.22 25)`  | `oklch(54.85% 0.2 27)`   | 5.41:1 light, 3.88:1 dark      |
  | `--status-info`    | `oklch(60% 0.13 240)` | `oklch(54% 0.155 250)`   | 5.06:1 light, 4.15:1 dark      |

  If you were relying on success being forest green or warning being brand
  amber — for instance to make a badge match a button — that is the coupling
  this change removes. Use `--anchor` or `--accent` explicitly if you wanted the
  brand colour; use the status token if you wanted the status.

  ### 3. A warning fill or rule must now be edged — BREAKING

  `--status-warning` is **1.87:1** and cannot be drawn bare. Yellow that clears
  3:1 on white is olive, which is not a caution colour, so the floor is carried
  by a separate token:

  ```css
  /* before */
  .my-callout {
    border-color: var(--status-warning);
  }

  /* after */
  .my-callout {
    border-color: var(--status-warning-border);
  } /* 3.76:1 light, 11.22:1 dark */
  ```

  Every place you paint `--status-warning` as a stripe, a rule, a dot or a fill
  edge, swap in `--status-warning-border`. The fill itself is still
  `--status-warning`, but it needs the border around it. This is the only status
  state with the asymmetry — success, danger and info clear 3:1 as bare fills in
  both themes.

  ### 4. Two new members per status state

  Each state now has five tokens instead of three:
  - `--status-X` — the fill. Never text.
  - `--status-X-on` — **new**, the text drawn _on_ that fill. 5.17 / 11.22 / 5.41 / 5.06.
  - `--status-X-fg` — status text on `--bg` / `--surface`.
  - `--status-X-tint` — the quiet panel background.
  - `--status-X-tint-edge` — **new**, that panel's hairline.

  If you were drawing a label on a status fill and reaching for `--fg-inverse`
  or `--fg-on-signal`, replace it with `--status-X-on`.

  Neither of the old choices can be right in both themes, because both move
  while the fill under them does not. `--fg-inverse` is white in light and black
  in dark; on the previous token set that already failed two cells —
  `text-info-foreground` on `bg-info` at **3.88:1** in light, and
  `text-destructive-foreground` on `bg-destructive` at **4.38:1** in dark. With
  the status hues re-picked in this release it would have failed three different
  cells instead (success 4.06, danger 3.88, info 4.15, all in dark) while fixing
  light — trading one theme's failures for the other's.

  `--fg-on-signal` is the second half and was latent rather than live: it
  resolves to `--accent-fg`, which is ink under `ember` and white under `slate`,
  so a warning label on the 1.87:1 yellow fill drops to **1.87:1** as soon as a
  second palette exists. One palette hid it.

  `--status-X-on` is the token measured against the fill it is drawn on, and it
  holds at 5.17 / 11.22 / 5.41 / 5.06 in all four palette x theme combinations.
  The Tailwind bridge's `--color-*-foreground` aliases are repointed to it, so
  if you use `text-success-foreground`, `text-warning-foreground`,
  `text-destructive-foreground` or `text-info-foreground`, their rendered colour
  changes and the pairing now holds in every cell.

  If you use `bg-*-tint`, `border-*-tint-edge` is the hairline that goes with it.

  ### 5. New: eight categorical chart colours

  `--chart-1` … `--chart-8`, plus `--chart-grid` and `--chart-axis`. Eight hues
  at one lightness and one chroma so no series shouts louder than another,
  ordered so consecutive slots are at least 90° apart. Palette-independent: a
  chart does not restyle itself when the brand does. Light 3.34–3.90:1 (fills
  and strokes only), dark 8.61–9.59:1 (which also clears 4.5:1 for in-chart
  labels). A legend still needs a label or a shape — colour is never the only
  channel (SC 1.4.1). Tailwind: `bg-chart-1` … `text-chart-8`.

  ### 6. New: targets, safe areas, scrim

  `--target-min: 24px` (the SC 2.5.8 floor), `--target: 44px`,
  `--target-lg: 56px`; `--safe-t` / `-r` / `-b` / `-l` reading `env(safe-area-inset-*)`;
  and `--scrim` for the wash behind a modal (0.56 light, 0.72 dark). Tailwind
  gets `min-h-target`, `size-target-min`, `bg-scrim`. The safe-area tokens are
  deliberately not aliased into a utility — an inset is added to an existing
  pad, not substituted for it, so write
  `pb-[calc(var(--space-4)+var(--safe-b))]`.

  `[data-platform="mobile"]` raises every `button`, `[role="button"]`,
  `a.ds-button`, `input:not([type='range'])` and `select` to 44px, and coarsens
  radii and the small end of the type ramp. It changes **no colour**, so every
  measured ratio still holds on a phone.

  ### 7. `--n-h` / `--n-mult`, and where a token override goes

  The neutral ramp is mixed from two palette-owned dials —
  `oklch(<L>% calc(<C> * var(--n-mult)) var(--n-h))`. Lightness is untouched by
  either, and lightness is what carries contrast, so a palette can take the greys
  from near-achromatic to charcoal without moving a measured neutral ratio. That
  is asserted, not assumed: across every neutral foreground on every neutral
  surface in both themes, the largest disagreement between the two palettes is
  0.003:1, which is two orders of magnitude below the gap between any two WCAG
  thresholds. If you have your own greys, this is the mechanism to copy — put
  them on the same two dials rather than declaring a second ramp.

  If you override tokens in your own `:root`, note that `palettes.css` and
  `mobile.css` are `@import`ed _before_ `tokens.css`'s own declarations, and a
  bare `[data-*]` selector ties with `:root` at (0,1,0). Your own unlayered
  `:root` block still wins over all of it, as before. But if you were overriding
  a brand token by re-declaring the ramp step it points at, point at the
  semantic token instead — the ramps are the palette's now.

  ### 8. `::selection` and `--fg-on-signal`

  `::selection` hardcoded `--signal-500` with ink text, which is amber under
  every palette and the wrong foreground under half of them. It is
  `var(--accent)` / `var(--accent-fg)` now. `--fg-on-signal` is kept as a
  documented alias of `--accent-fg`; new code should use `--accent-fg`.

  ## Verification

  `contrast.test.mjs` now sweeps **palette × theme** — four combinations, not
  two — and asserts three things a two-theme sweep could not see: that every
  `--status-*` and `--chart-*` resolves identically under both palettes, that
  every neutral measures identically under both, and that no block declares a
  token under a selector the resolver does not understand. The two un-inverted
  brand tints (`--accent-tint` / `--anchor-tint` sat at the `50` step in dark
  mode, a 97%-light chip on a black page) are fixed and would now fail the
  build. The exception for `--status-warning` is written into `CONTRAST_RULES`'
  `except` map with its reason and is asserted from both sides: the fill under
  3:1, and `--status-warning-border` over it.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 242fbe0: First release: an MCP server over the installed design-system packages, on `@modelcontextprotocol/server` v2 (`serveStdio` factory wiring). Five tools — `get_component` (props, sub-components, and constraints in one call), `search_tokens`, `get_constraints`, `get_brand_guidance`, `check_adherence` — plus the brand voice and contract set mirrored as resources. Everything reads the consumer's `node_modules` and never the network, so it cannot go stale; every failure message enumerates the valid alternatives so an agent can retry.

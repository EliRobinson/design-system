 * Local modifications, applied by scripts/ai-elements-transforms.mjs:
 *   (none — byte-identical to upstream below the header)
 *
 * Re-pull with `pnpm sync:elements`. An edit made here instead is detected
 * as local divergence and makes the next upstream bump fail loudly rather
 * than silently reverting your change.

 * Local modifications, applied by scripts/ai-elements-transforms.mjs:
 *   - workspace-alias: rewrote @repo/shadcn-ui/* imports to paths inside this package
 *
 * Re-pull with `pnpm sync:elements`. An edit made here instead is detected
 * as local divergence and makes the next upstream bump fail loudly rather
